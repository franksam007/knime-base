	<name>Low Variance Filter</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Filters out numeric columns, which have a low variance.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				Filters out double-compatible columns, whose variance is below
				a user defined threshold. Columns with low variance are likely to 
				distract certain learning algorithms (in particular those which are
				distance based) and are therefore better removed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note, the input table should not be normalized with a Gaussian 
				normalization or any other normalization technique which changes
				the variances of the input.
			</p>		
		</intro>

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Variance Upper Bound">
				Choose a variance value here. The higher the value, the more columns
				are likely to get filtered out. Choose 0 to filter for columns, which
				only contain one constant value.
			</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Column Filter">      
			<option name="Include">
				This list contains the names of the columns that are considered for
				filtering. Any other column will be left untouched (i.e. will also
				be present in the output table independent of their variance).
			</option>

			<option name="Enforce Inclusion">
				Select this option to enforce the current inclusion list to stay
				the same even if the input table specification changes. 
				New columns will automatically be added to the exclusion list.
			</option>				

			<option name="Buttons">
				Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
                list. Single-arrow buttons will move all selected columns.
                Double-arrow buttons will move all columns (filtering is taken into
                account).
			</option>

			<option name="Filter">
				Use one of these fields to filter either the Include or Exclude
                list for certain column names or name substrings.
			</option>

			<option name="Exclude">
				This list contains the names of the columns of the input table
				that will be left untouched (i.e. will also be present
				in the output table independent of their variance).
			</option>

			<option name="Enforce Exclusion">
				Select this option to enforce the current exclusion list to stay
				the same even if the input table specification changes. 
				New columns will automatically be added to the inclusion list.
			</option>

		</tab>	

		<tab name="Wildcard/Regex Selection">
        	<option name="">
				Type a search pattern which matches columns to move into the
				Include list. You can use either Wildcards ('?' matching any
				character, '*' matching a sequence of any characters) or Regex.
				You can specify if your pattern should be case sensitive.
			</option>
