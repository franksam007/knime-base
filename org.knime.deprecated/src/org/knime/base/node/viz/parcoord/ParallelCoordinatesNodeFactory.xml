            Numerical and nominal data is shown in a parallel coordinate
		    display where axes are depicted in parallel as vertical lines.
	   		A vector of the input space is visualized as
			a line, connecting each attribute's value on each axis. (Fuzzy)
			Rules are represented by bands, visualizing the corresponding
			intervals (the core regions in the case of fuzzy rules).
